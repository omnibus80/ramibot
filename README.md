## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose (required only for the Rami-Kali MCP tools, Docker terminal, and Tor features)
- About 3.2 GB of free disk space for the G9v3-3B Heretic Q8_0 GGUF model
- Git, Node.js 18+ with npm, Python 3.9+, Docker Engine/Compose, and an ngrok account token for a public URL (Linux setup installs missing packages on supported distros)

### Windows Installer (easiest)

Download `RamiBot-Setup-v3.8.0.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RamiBotAI/ramibot/releases), run it, and follow the wizard.

The wizard installs Python, Node.js, and Docker Desktop if they are missing, then downloads the model, installs Osiris and ngrok, and asks for an ngrok token at the end. Launch RamiBot from the desktop shortcut; the world-intelligence panel is embedded in the same UI.

> **First launch:** Docker Desktop may require WSL2 setup or a reboot. RamiBot starts the GGUF and Kali services when the Docker daemon is available; the application UI and Osiris run as local Node/Python processes.

## 🎥 Full Installation Demo (Windows)

    <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/69mGhEFiuXU/maxresdefault.jpg" width="600"style="border-radius:10px;">
  </a>
</p>

### Quick Start (Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamiBotAI/ramibot.git
cd ramibot
bash setup.sh
```

The setup installs missing Linux tools, downloads/verifies the G9v3 GGUF, clones Osiris, configures the app, then asks for ngrok credentials as its final setup prompt. Leave the domain blank for an assigned ngrok URL. Optional Osiris data-source keys remain blank; keyless feeds work without them. Docker Engine/Compose is required only for the Rami-Kali MCP container; llama.cpp, Osiris, the backend, and UI run as native processes. Set `RAMIBOT_ALLOW_NO_DOCKER=1` only for an explicit development run that cannot use Kali tools.

The setup starts llama.cpp, Osiris, the backend, the UI, and ngrok. It chooses another port if a preferred port is occupied, waits for services, then prints the final public UI URL. Osiris is embedded in the RamiBot panel, not opened as another tab or container. On systemd Linux hosts, accept the service prompt to enable restart-on-failure and boot persistence.

### Setup Changes

Previously, local-model use expected a separately managed LM Studio/Ollama endpoint, Osiris was not installed or started by RamiBot, and startup relied on fixed ports and separately configured tunnel steps. The current Linux setup downloads the pinned G9v3-3B Heretic Q8_0 model into this checkout's ignored `models/gguf/`, builds/starts native llama.cpp, clones Osiris into ignored `osiris/`, embeds it at `/osiris`, assigns free ports, and prompts for ngrok credentials after installation. Rami-Kali remains the only Docker workload required by the complete Linux app. The optional systemd unit supervises the native app processes and restarts the service after failure or reboot.

Generation uses 4096 tokens per model request and continues with additional requests whenever llama.cpp reports that the current chunk ended at its token limit. Continuation ends when the model returns a normal completion; incomplete tool-call payloads are rejected rather than executed. Parallel specialist work accepts up to five tasks and runs up to five workers.

After install, add any optional API keys in **Settings**, then:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
bash start.sh

# Windows
start.bat
```

`start.sh` / `start.bat` launches backend + frontend in the background and opens `http://localhost:5173` after 4 seconds. The rami-kali container is left running on shutdown (`restart: unless-stopped`).

### Manual install (alternative)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ramibot
```

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

**One command (after install):**

```bash
bash start.sh      # Linux / macOS
start.bat          # Windows
```

**Two terminals (manual):**

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Makefile (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
make install
make dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Overview

RamiBot is a self-hosted chat application built for security engineers who need a controllable, extensible interface between LLMs and operational tooling.

It does not depend on any cloud chat product. Conversations are stored locally in SQLite. Provider API keys are configured at runtime. All tool execution happens inside Docker containers.

The core differentiator is the **skill pipeline**: a prompt engineering system that detects the operational context from user input (reconnaissance, exploitation, defense, analysis, reporting), selects the appropriate skill, and injects structured methodology instructions into the system prompt before each LLM call. Team mode (red or blue) controls which skills are available and how the LLM frames its responses.

**Who it is for:**

- Security engineers running structured red team or blue team workflows
- Analysts who need LLM-assisted reasoning alongside real tool execution via MCP
- Researchers integrating local models (Ollama, LM Studio) into security workflows
- Teams that need full local data control with no cloud dependency for conversation history

```

**Data flow for a streaming chat request:**

1. Frontend sends `POST /api/chat/stream` with conversation ID, provider, model, team mode, MCP flag, and optional `require_tool_approval`
2. Backend loads conversation history from SQLite
3. If MCP is enabled: skill pipeline classifies the input, selects a skill, builds a system prompt, and injects it as the first message in history
4. Adapter streams the LLM response as Server-Sent Events (token events)
5. If the LLM emits a tool call and **Approval Mode** is on: backend yields a `tool_approval_required` SSE event and waits (up to 120 s) for the operator's decision via `POST /api/chat/approve`; auto-denies on timeout
6. If approved (or Approval Mode is off): the MCP client executes the tool, the result is appended to history, and a follow-up generation is triggered
7. Backend saves the final message to SQLite with token usage and latency
8. Frontend renders tokens incrementally and tool traces in real time

---

## Skill System

The skill system is invoked on every MCP-enabled chat request. It classifies input, selects a skill, and builds a structured system prompt tailored to the operation phase and team mode.

### Components

| Component | File | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| `SkillPipeline` | `skills/pipeline.py` | Orchestrates the full build-prompt flow |
| `InputClassifier` | `skills/classifier.py` | Regex and substring trigger matching |
| `PromptComposer` | `skills/composer.py` | Assembles system prompt from selected skill |
| `SkillRegistry` | `skills/registry.py` | Loads skill definitions from JSON |

### Skill Definitions

| Skill | Teams | Priority | Risk | Trigger examples |
|-------|-------|----------|------|------------------|
| `recon` | red, blue | 10 | low | scan, nmap, enumerate, port, subdomain, dns |
| `exploit` | red only | 20 | high | exploit, payload, shell, rce, xss, sqli, privesc, metasploit |
| `defense` | blue only | 20 | low | harden, firewall, patch, mitigate, incident, siem, ids |
| `analysis` | red, blue | 30 | low | analyze, log, traffic, pcap, forensic, anomaly, wireshark |
| `reporting` | red, blue | 50 | low | report, document, executive, findings, export |
| `burp_expert` | red, blue | 15 | high | burp, web app, proxy history, repeater, intruder, fuzz, owasp |

### Pipeline Logic

1. **Trigger classification**: Word-boundary regex matches user input against skill trigger lists
2. **Phase inference**: If no triggers match, the last 3 messages are scanned for phase markers (`[RECON]`, `payload`, `patch`, etc.)
3. **Dominant skill selection**: Highest-priority match wins. `reporting` is suppressed if `exploit` or `defense` is also matched.
4. **Fallback**: No match defaults to the team default (recon for red, analysis for blue)
5. **Context extraction**: IPv4, URL, and `host:port` patterns are extracted from input and recent history and injected as `CONTEXT TARGET` in the prompt
6. **Execution intent**: Imperative verbs ("run", "execute", "scan", "exploit") are detected and signaled to the composer
7. **Prompt assembly**: Team preamble + skill methodology section + `EVIDENCE_RULES` + `COMMON_FOOTER`
8. **Audit log**: Every decision is appended as JSON to `skill_decisions.log`

### Team Modes

**Red (`team_mode: "red"`)**
- Preamble: authorized engagement, attacker perspective, tool-first
- Active skills: recon, exploit, analysis, reporting
- Priority order: exploit > recon > analysis > reporting

**Blue (`team_mode: "blue"`)**
- Preamble: incident responder, remediation-driven
- Active skills: defense, analysis, reporting, recon
- Priority order: defense > analysis > reporting > recon

Team mode is selected per conversation from the sidebar toggle and persisted in localStorage.

## Evidence-Locked Reporting

RamiBot enforces a strict evidence discipline across all team modes and all skills to prevent LLM hallucinations in security reports and operational output.

### How it works

**Tool result wrapping (`backend/main.py`):**

Every successful MCP tool result is wrapped in immutable evidence tags before being injected into the LLM's follow-up context:

```
[EVIDENCE BLOCK — DO NOT MODIFY]
<raw tool output>
[END OF EVIDENCE]
```

**Global enforcement (`backend/skills/composer.py`):**

`EVIDENCE_RULES` is injected into every system prompt regardless of team mode or skill. Ten mandatory rules apply to all responses:

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Only Evidence Block content is fact | No information from model training cited as operational finding |
| No fabricated versions / CVEs / CVSS | `"Version not detected."` / `"Requires manual validation."` / score omitted |
| No external gap-filling | If nmap shows a service with no version, no version is assumed |
| No inferred properties | Encryption status, authentication state, EOL status, exploitability, internet exposure, and credential weakness may only be stated if the Evidence Block explicitly contains them |
| Conditional risk language | Forbidden: `"is vulnerable"`, `"is exploitable"`, `"is exposed"`. Required: `"may be"`, `"appears to"`, `"consistent with"` — unless the tool itself uses assertive language |
| Severity from confirmed findings only | No Critical/High/Medium/Low from port number, service name, or version string alone. Default: `"Informational"` if no vulnerability is explicitly reported |
| Three-layer output discipline | `[RAW OUTPUT]` / `[PARSED DATA]` / `[INTERPRETATION]` clearly separated |
| No Evidence Block → no fabrication | State `"No tool output available"` and stop |
| Service-Bound CVE Correlation | Each CVE result carries a `SERVICE BINDING` line (derived from CPE data). A CVE may only be attached to the detected service whose name matches that binding — never reassigned across unrelated services on the same host |
| CVE Query Lock | `cve_lookup` queries must be derived from the exact product name and version string in the Evidence Block. Forbidden: host IP as query input; semantic pivots to adjacent software (Apache detected → do not query Log4j); famous CVEs introduced from background knowledge without confirmed product presence |

**Skill-level reinforcement:**

Each skill definition carries its own `EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE:` note scoped to its operational context:

- `recon`: report only scan output; no added versions or CVEs
- `exploit`: CVE candidates are hypotheses (`"may be vulnerable — requires validation"`), not confirmed matches
- `analysis`: TTP attribution uses conditional language only (`"consistent with"`, `"suggests"`)
- `defense`: remediation only for confirmed findings; no hypothetical patching
- `reporting`: verbatim Evidence Block excerpts in the Evidence field; severity and CVSS only from tool output

### Reasoning block stripping

When reasoning-capable models (LM Studio / DeepSeek / QwQ) emit `<think>...</think>` content, it is stripped at two independent points:

1. **Storage layer** (`store.js` — `stripReasoning()`): applied to `fullContent` before it is committed to the messages array. Stored messages and SQLite records never contain reasoning blocks.
2. **Export layer** (`reportPdf.js`): three-pass cleaning before HTML rendering — strip reasoning tags, discard content before `<!-- REPORT -->` marker, strip internal markers. Defense-in-depth for messages stored before the stripping was deployed.

---

## LLM Integration

All providers implement a common `BaseAdapter` interface:

```python
async def capabilities() -> dict
async def list_models() -> list[dict]
async def generate(messages, model, **kwargs) -> dict
async def stream(messages, model, **kwargs) -> AsyncGenerator[dict, None]
```

Streaming events emitted by all adapters:

| Event | Payload |
|-------|---------|
| `token` | `{"data": "<text>"}` |
| `tool_call` | `{"data": {"id", "name", "arguments"}}` |
| `usage` | `{"data": {"prompt_tokens", "completion_tokens", "total_tokens"}}` |
| `done` | `{"data": None}` |

### Supported Providers

**OpenAI**
- Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1` (configurable base URL) — or `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` when OAuth token is used
- Auth: `api_key` → `Authorization: Bearer`; `oauth_token` (from `~/.codex/auth.json`) → ChatGPT backend with JWT-extracted `chatgpt-account-id`
- Models: fetched dynamically from `/v1/models` (API key mode); static GPT-5.x Codex list (OAuth mode)
- Tool calling: yes (OpenAI format)
- Reasoning: yes (o1/o3/o4 series via `reasoning_effort`)
- Streaming: yes — Chat Completions SSE (API key) / Responses API SSE (OAuth)

**Anthropic**
- Endpoint: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`
- Auth: `api_key` → `x-api-key`; `oauth_token` (format `sk-ant-oat01-*`) → `Authorization: Bearer` — currently blocked by Anthropic for third-party use
- Models: fetched dynamically from `/v1/models` (API key); static Claude 3.x–4.x list (OAuth, validated by token prefix)
- Tool calling: yes (tool_use blocks; input schema sanitized to remove oneOf/anyOf/allOf)
- Reasoning: yes (extended thinking via `thinking.budget_tokens`)
- Streaming: yes (Anthropic SSE event protocol)

**OpenRouter**
- Endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (configurable)
- Models: fetched dynamically from OpenRouter API
- Tool calling: yes (OpenAI-compatible)
- Reasoning: no

**LM Studio**
- Endpoint: configurable (default `http://localhost:1234/v1`)
- Models: fetched from local LM Studio instance
- Tool calling: yes (accumulated across stream chunks)
- Reasoning: yes (filters `<think>...</think>` blocks; appends `/no_think` suffix when disabled)
- Timeout: 300s

**Ollama**
- Endpoint: configurable (default `http://localhost:11434`)
- Models: fetched from local Ollama instance
- Tool calling: no
- Reasoning: no
- Token counts: from `eval_count` / `prompt_eval_count`

### Context Handling

- Full conversation history is sent on every request (no summarization or windowing)
- System prompt from the skill pipeline is injected as the first history entry
- After a tool call: the assistant message with `tool_calls` and the tool result messages are appended before the follow-up generation
- Token usage and latency are stored per message in SQLite

---

## MCP Integration

RamiBot implements the Model Context Protocol client for connecting external tool servers.

### Connection Types

- **stdio**: Spawns a local subprocess and communicates via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout. Uses a background reader thread (compatible with Windows selector loop limitation).
- **HTTP**: POST requests to a remote MCP server URL.

### Tool Namespacing

All tools are prefixed: `{server_name}__{tool_name}`. This allows multiple MCP servers to coexist without name collisions. The prefix is stripped before the server call.

### Persistence

MCP server configurations are stored in the SQLite `mcp_servers` table. On startup, all saved servers are automatically reconnected.

### Schema Normalization

Tool schemas are wrapped in `{"type": "function", "function": {...}}` format for OpenAI-style tool calling compatibility across all adapters.

### Disabling Tools

Individual tools can be disabled per session from the Settings modal. Disabled names are sent in `ChatRequest.disabled_tools` and filtered before injection into the LLM context.

---

## Rami-Kali MCP Server

RamiBot ships with a pre-integrated red team toolserver built on Kali Linux and delivered as a Docker container (`rami-kali/`).

### Overview

- **45 pentest tools** available as MCP tools, callable by the LLM during any MCP-enabled session
- **Auto-connection**: on first backend startup, RamiBot seeds the `rami-kali` MCP server entry automatically — no manual configuration required
- **Transport**: stdio via `docker exec -i rami-kali python3 /opt/rami-kali/mcp_server.py`
- **Scope enforcement**: `config.yaml` inside the container defines allowed target ranges; the server rejects out-of-scope calls
- **Evidence gate**: tool output is only forwarded to the LLM after a scope check passes
- **Audit log**: every tool call is appended to an internal audit trail

### Tool Categories

| Category | Example tools |
|----------|---------------|
| Recon | nmap, masscan, whois, theHarvester, amass, subfinder, dnsx |
| Web | nikto, gobuster, ffuf, nuclei, sqlmap, whatweb, wafw00f |
| CVE Intelligence | cve_lookup (NVD 2.0 API — exact CVE ID, keyword, CPE name, match string, severity filter, date ranges; returns CVSS, SERVICE BINDING, CPEs, references) |
| Proxy routing | proxychains4 (Burp profile + Tor profile) |
| Exploit | metasploit-framework, searchsploit, msfvenom |
| Credential | hydra, medusa, hashcat, john, crackmapexec |
| SMB / AD | enum4linux, smbclient, bloodhound, impacket suite |
| Wireless | aircrack-ng, reaver, hcxtools |
| Social eng | gophish, setoolkit |

### Knowledge Base

`rami-kali/knowledge/` contains 28 structured Markdown files used by the MCP server to prepend tactical context to tool results. Categories include: tool usage guides, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, result interpretation guides, and operational checklists.

### Proxy Routing (proxychains4)

The container ships with two ready-made proxychains4 profiles for routing tool traffic through Burp Suite or Tor without modifying any tool configuration:

| Mode | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Analysis only | `proxychains <tool>` | Routes through Burp on Windows host |
| Anonymity only | `proxychains -f /etc/proxychains4-tor.conf <tool>` | Routes through Tor inside the container |
| Analysis + anonymity | Start Tor in RamiBot → configure Burp SOCKS upstream → `proxychains <tool>` | tool → Burp → Tor → internet |

**Burp → Tor chaining:** In Burp Suite, go to **Settings → Network → Connections → SOCKS proxy** and set `127.0.0.1:9050`. This works because the container uses `network_mode: host`, so `127.0.0.1` resolves to the Windows host running Tor.

Profile paths inside the container:
- `/etc/proxychains4.conf` — routes through Burp (default `proxychains` command)
- `/etc/proxychains4-tor.conf` — routes directly through Tor TransPort

The `gobuster_dir` MCP tool accepts a `proxy` parameter to route directory bruteforce traffic through a specific proxy (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080` for Burp or `socks5://127.0.0.1:9050` for Tor).

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the image (one-time)
make rami-kali-build

# Start the container
make rami-kali-start

# View logs
make rami-kali-logs

# Stop
make rami-kali-stop
```

On next backend start, `[MCP] Auto-configured rami-kali server 'rami-kali'` will appear in the logs and the server will be listed in Settings > MCP with its full tool set.

---

## Docker Terminal

RamiBot includes a browser-based terminal connected to a Docker container via `docker exec`.

### Platform Behavior

- **Unix**: `pty.openpty()` for full PTY allocation. Supports interactive programs (vim, tmux, etc.), resize events, and full ANSI rendering.
- **Windows**: Pipe-based communication (`docker exec -i`). Uses `script` utility for PTY emulation if available; falls back to plain bash. Shell detection in `terminal.py` prefers **zsh → bash → sh**. The rami-kali container runs zsh by default with `zsh-syntax-highlighting` (valid commands turn green, invalid turn red) and `zsh-autosuggestions` (press Tab or → to accept suggestions from history).

### Session Lifecycle

| Step | Endpoint |
|------|----------|
| Create session | `POST /api/terminal/start` |
| Stream output (SSE, base64) | `GET /api/terminal/stream?session_id=X` |
| Send input (base64) | `POST /api/terminal/input` |
| Resize PTY | `POST /api/terminal/resize` |
| Terminate session | `POST /api/terminal/stop` |

Up to 2 concurrent terminal panels can be open simultaneously in the UI.

### Tor Transparent Proxy

When a Docker container has `NET_ADMIN` capability:

- `POST /api/docker/tor {"action": "start"}` installs iptables rules to redirect TCP traffic through Tor TransPort (9040) and DNS through port 5353
- `POST /api/docker/tor {"action": "stop"}` removes the rules and stops the Tor process
- `GET /api/docker/tor` returns `{ running, transparent_proxy, kill_switch }`

Requires a Tor installation inside the container. Intended for use in isolated lab environments only.

### 🔴 Rami-Kali (Core MCP Tool Server)

Rami-Kali is the official MCP tool server for RamiBot and provides real penetration testing tooling (nmap, metasploit, hydra, etc.).

While RamiBot can run as an AI-only interface, its full operational capability is unlocked when rami-kali is running.

Docker is required for rami-kali.

#### Prerequisite
Docker installed and running.

- Windows / macOS: Docker Desktop
- Linux: Docker Engine



#### 1. Build the image

```bash
# Via Makefile
make rami-kali-build

# Or directly
docker build -t rami-kali rami-kali/
```

The image is based on `kalilinux/kali-rolling` and installs ~60 penetration testing tools. The first build takes several minutes depending on your connection.

#### 2. Start the container

```bash
# Via Makefile
make rami-kali-start

# Or directly
docker compose -f rami-kali/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### 3. Verify

```bash
docker ps | grep rami-kali
```

#### 4. Scope configuration

Allowed target ranges are managed from **Settings > Scope** in the UI. Changes are written to `rami-kali/config.yaml` and the container is restarted automatically — no rebuild required.

You can also edit the file directly before starting the container:

```yaml
security:
  require_scope_check: true   # set to false to disable enforcement
  allowed_scope:
    - "192.168.1.0/24"
    - "10.0.0.0/8"
    - "172.16.0.0/12"
```

The MCP server rejects any tool call whose target IP falls outside these ranges.

#### Auto-registration

On the next backend startup, RamiBot detects the running container and registers it as an MCP server automatically:

```
[MCP] Auto-configured rami-kali server 'rami-kali'
```

The server appears in **Settings > MCP** with its full tool list. No manual configuration needed.

#### Container management

```bash
make rami-kali-stop      # stop the container
make rami-kali-logs      # follow logs
make rami-kali-build     # rebuild after changes

docker exec -it rami-kali zsh    # open a zsh shell inside
```

---

## Configuration

### Provider Credentials

API keys and base URLs are configured through the Settings modal in the UI and saved to `backend/settings.json`.

| Provider | Field | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| OpenAI | `api_key` | From `platform.openai.com` |
| OpenAI | `oauth_token` | ChatGPT Plus/Pro via Codex CLI — overrides `api_key` if set |
| Anthropic | `api_key` | From `console.anthropic.com` |
| Anthropic | `oauth_token` | Reserved — blocked by Anthropic for third-party use as of Feb 2026 |
| OpenRouter | `api_key` | From `openrouter.ai` |
| LM Studio | `base_url` | Default `http://localhost:1234/v1` |
| Ollama | `base_url` | Default `http://localhost:11434` |

**OpenAI OAuth token** — use the `access_token` from `~/.codex/auth.json` (generated by `openai/codex` CLI after `codex` login). When set without an API key, RamiBot routes requests to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` using your ChatGPT subscription instead of platform billing. The account ID is extracted automatically from the JWT. Available models: GPT-5.x Codex series.

### Docker

Set the container name in Settings > Docker. The container will be started automatically if it is stopped when a terminal session is requested.

### MCP Servers

Add MCP servers from Settings > MCP. Each server requires:

- **Name**: identifier used for tool namespacing
- **Type**: stdio (command + args) or remote (HTTP URL)

Servers are persisted in SQLite and reconnected on backend restart.

> **Note:** The `rami-kali` server is pre-configured automatically on first startup if the `rami-kali` Docker container is running. No manual entry is needed. If the container is not running, the server will appear as disconnected in Settings > MCP and can be reconnected after starting the container with `make rami-kali-start`.

### Scope

Allowed target ranges for the `rami-kali` MCP server are managed from **Settings > Scope**.

- Add or remove CIDR ranges with immediate visual feedback
- Toggle **Enforce Scope Check** to enable or disable enforcement entirely
- Click **SAVE & RESTART** to write `rami-kali/config.yaml` and restart the container in one action

No Docker rebuild is required. The config file is bind-mounted, so the container picks up the new values on restart.

The underlying file (`rami-kali/config.yaml`) can also be edited directly — the UI reads from it on load.

### Skill Log

All skill activation decisions are written to `backend/skill_decisions.log` in newline-delimited JSON. Each entry contains: timestamp, team mode, input snippet, matched triggers, activated skills, risk level, extracted target, prompt length.

```bash
GET  /api/skills/log?limit=50   # retrieve
DELETE /api/skills/log          # clear
```

Also accessible from Settings > Skill Log in the UI.

### Environment Variables

`.env.example` is provided as a reference template:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./ramibot.db
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
```

Note: runtime credentials are read from `backend/settings.json` (written by the UI), not from `.env`. The `.env` file is a reference template.

## Usage

### Basic Chat

1. Select a provider and model from the top bar
2. Type a message and press Enter
3. Response streams token by token in real time

### Red Team Session

1. Set team mode to **Red** in the sidebar
2. Enable **MCP** if tool execution is needed
3. Start with a recon prompt:

```
scan 10.10.10.0/24 for open ports and services
```

The pipeline detects the recon context, injects nmap methodology instructions, and routes any `nmap__*` tool calls to the MCP server.

4. Follow up with exploitation:

```
enumerate SMB shares on 10.10.10.15 and check for anonymous access
```

The pipeline transitions to the exploit skill. Tool results from each step are fed back into history for chained reasoning.

### Blue Team Session

1. Set team mode to **Blue**
2. Enable MCP
3. Analyze:

```
analyze these auth.log entries for brute force indicators: [paste logs]
```

The pipeline selects the analysis skill. The LLM returns a structured timeline, IOCs, and mitigations.

4. Remediate:

```
harden SSH configuration on Ubuntu 22.04 to prevent this attack vector
```

The pipeline transitions to the defense skill, returning severity-tagged findings with exact commands.

### MCP Tool Execution

When MCP is enabled and the LLM emits a tool call:

1. The tool call is displayed in real time as a collapsible trace in the chat
2. The MCP client executes the tool against the configured server
3. The result is displayed and injected back into the LLM context
4. The LLM generates a follow-up response interpreting the result

### Tool Approval Gate

When **Approval Mode** is enabled (sidebar toggle, visible only when MCP is active), RamiBot pauses before executing every MCP tool call and waits for explicit operator confirmation.

**Enabling it:**

1. Enable MCP in the sidebar
2. The **Approval Mode** toggle appears — activate it

**What happens on a tool call:**

1. A banner appears inline between the chat and the message input, showing:
   - The tool short name (prefix stripped) and up to 4 key arguments (`target`, `host`, `port`, etc.)
   - A **risk badge** colored by level: `low` (green), `medium` (amber), `high` (orange), `critical` (red) — sourced from `rami-kali/config.yaml → risk_levels`
   - A **countdown timer** from 120 s; turns red at ≤ 15 s
2. Click **APPROVE** → tool executes normally; stream continues
3. Click **DENY** → backend injects `[TOOL EXECUTION DENIED BY USER]` into the LLM context; LLM reports the denial and suggests alternatives
4. **Timeout** (120 s with no response) → auto-denied; banner shows "TIMED OUT — AUTO-DENIED"
5. Pressing **Stop** mid-approval clears the banner immediately

Risk levels are read from `rami-kali/config.yaml → risk_levels`. Tools not listed default to `medium`.

### Findings Database

Tool execution results can be saved as structured security findings for later review and export.

**Saving a finding:**

1. Expand any tool trace in the chat (click the tool name row)
2. Click **SAVE AS FINDING** at the bottom of the trace
3. The modal pre-fills the title (`tool → target`), description (cleaned evidence gate text — no raw JSON), and target from the tool arguments
4. Select severity (Info / Low / Medium / High / Critical) and save

**Reviewing findings:**

Open **Settings > Findings** to see all saved findings. From there you can:

- Filter by severity
- Expand long descriptions inline (▼ SHOW MORE / ▲ SHOW LESS)
- Export the filtered set as **JSON** or **CSV** (respects the active severity filter)
- Export a single finding as JSON or CSV using the per-card buttons
- Delete individual findings

**Description extraction:**

The finding description is auto-populated from the tool's evidence gate — the structured summary block that RamiBot's MCP server prepends to every tool result. This gives clean, human-readable evidence (verified facts, status, finding count) without raw JSON dumps or internal instruction text.

### Reporting and PDF Export

The reporting skill generates structured security reports (executive summary, per-finding analysis, attack path, recommendations, appendix). All claims in the report are constrained by the Evidence-Locked Reporting rules — severity, CVEs, and CVSS scores only appear when explicitly present in tool output.

After generating a report, the LLM offers PDF export:

> *¿Quieres exportar este reporte como PDF? Escribe **pdf** para descargarlo.*

Type `pdf` (or `sí`, `dale`, `yes`, etc.) — the frontend intercepts the message without making an LLM call, opens a print-ready window, and triggers the browser print dialog automatically.

The PDF export runs three cleaning passes before rendering:
1. Strip `<think>...</think>` / `<thinking>...</thinking>` blocks (internal model reasoning — never included in deliverables)
2. If `<!-- REPORT -->` marker is present, discard all content before it (removes any preamble or stray reasoning)
3. Strip the internal `<!-- REPORT -->` marker and PDF offer line

The PDF includes:
- **RamiBot logo** in the header with generation timestamp
- Full report in clean typography (sans-serif, proper heading hierarchy)
- Severity badges colored by level (`[CRITICAL]`, `[HIGH]`, etc.)
- Formatted tables, code blocks, and lists
- Print-optimized CSS with page-break handling

No additional npm packages are required — PDF generation uses the browser's native print-to-PDF capability via `window.print()`.

### Docker Terminal

1. Configure a container name in Settings > Docker
2. Click the terminal icon in the chat header to open a terminal panel
3. A second panel can be opened (max 2 concurrent)
4. The terminal runs inside the configured container via `docker exec`
